Interest
--------

- How computer (science) contribute to the real world, not only by utilizing computer, but to applying principles or theory of the computer science to the real world?
- Distributed Systems, Database Systems, High Availability, Functional Programming Languages, and Reliability/Performance Design for non-stop middleware servers.
- Functional Programming Languages
- What kind of man my son will grow to be?

Computer Skills
---------------

- C, C++, Erlang/OTP, Ruby, Python, OCaml.
- Server middleware programming in Linux (and other unix-like systems), reliability design.
- not fluent in Java


Work Experience
---------------

- Engineer, at NTT Information Sharing Platform Laboratories, April 2007 - current

 - 2011- open source: Development of `Jubatus <http://jubat.us>`_ - joint work with Preferred Structure Inc., writing C++, Python and OCaml.
 - 2008- proprietary: Development of scalable, highly available, data intensive software system using massive combination of inexpensive hardware. Developed 2-3 software written in C, C++.


Education
---------

- Master of Science, University of Tokyo, 2007

 - (Large Vocabulary Continuous) Speech Recognition
 - in Keikichi Hirose Lab.
 - A language-modelling system with prosodic feature-helps. The system has multiple language models and switches them as context state changes by watching prosodic features. The language model will be trained with statistic methods using a huge corpus of spontaneous Japanese which consists of hundreds of Kwords, hundreds of hours and gigabytes of metadatas. Its experiment program was implementation of Variational Bayesian method for inferring combination of Gaussian pdf, written in C++.

- BS in Electronic Information Engineering, University of Tokyo, 2005

 - Genetic Algorithm, Humanoid Robot
 - Hitoshi Iba Lab.
 - Trying an auto-evolution of neural networks with genetic algorithm (GA): controlling humanoid robot with recurrent neural network - I integrated robot controlling simulation system and neural network processing engine, with my own GA and neural network description generator (written in C++).
