Engineer, at NTT Information Sharing Platform Laboratories, April 2007 - current
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Education
---------

Master of Science, University of Tokyo, 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Concentration: (Large Vocabulary Continuous) Speech Recognition
Keikichi Hirose Lab.
Project:
A language-modelling system with prosodic feature-helps. The system has multiple language models and switches them as context state changes by watching prosodic features. The language model will be trained with statistic methods using a huge corpus of spontaneous Japanese which consists of hundreds of Kwords, hundreds of hours and gigabytes of metadatas. Its experiment program was implementation of Variational Bayesian method for inferring combination of Gaussian pdf, written in C++.

BS in Electronic Information Engineering, University of Tokyo, 2005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Concentration: Genetic Algorithm, Humanoid Robot
Hitoshi Iba Lab.
Project:
Trying an auto-evolution of neural networks with genetic algorithm (GA): controlling humanoid robot with recurrent neural network - I integrated robot controlling simulation system and neural network processing engine, with my own GA and neural network description generator (written in C++).


Other
-----

committer: `MessagePack <http://msgpack.org>`_ (2010-)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MessagePack is a binary-based efficient object serialization library. It enables to exchange structured objects between many languages like JSON. But unlike JSON, it is very fast and small. Participating as a committer of Erlang-binding of both MessagePack and MessagePack-RPC.

Yatce: yet another TokyoCabinet-Erlang binding (2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Erlang's built-in key/value storage system (dets) is very slow and its performance is bad. While TokyoCabinet is a blazingly-fast key/value storage system written in state-of-art C, Yatce connects it with Erlang. It is built into some proprietary software and being sold (Yatce itself is dual-licensed as LGPL/MIT).

Mercurial Localization (2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mercurial is a Python-based distributed version control software. My contribution was next to project leader, flying-foozy (Mr. Fujiwara) - Almost 200 messages.

Japanese translation of CouchDB: the Definitive Guide (2009-2011)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the book's script is open by CC-3.0 license, I started translation project with same licence.
